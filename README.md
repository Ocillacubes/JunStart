# JunStart
Another Custom Startpage, designed to change the workflow of using the web

# What is this?
I wasn't satisfied with my current startpage as I didnt have enough stacked into it and wanted to code on from scratch myself, using only css html and php. And so I did. Essentially there is a naviagtion menu at the top you can use to click through the categories to go to different sites, and a searchbar you can use to search throught the sites in sites.json. Additionally there is a duckduckgo search bar if you want to be *not cool* and use that. 

## Why is the search so bad
Because I wrote it lmao. It only takes exact matches to what's found in sites.json (all lowercase)

## Shortcut Codes for Search
Like duckduckgo's bangs, JunStart has shortcuts, although these don't need a !. They include:
* sg - Steam Gifts
* w2x - Waifu 2x
* mt - Monkey Type
* r - Reddit
* pimg - Post Images
* pcpp - PC Part Picker
* hcp - Hex Color Picker
* yt - Youtube
* scc - Select Coffee Crafters
* aw - Arch Wiki
* fid - Fidelity
* vndb - VNDB
* gw - Gentoo Wiki
* shchk - Shell Check
* gh - Github
* usdb - Usagi Seiyuu DB
* adb - AniDB
* alist - AniList
* amq - Anime Music Quiz
* ht - HoloTools
* tw - Twitter


## Current problems/todo
* Fix menu bar looping in smaller windows
* Make text scale
* Improve search

## Let me know if there are any sites/shortcuts you would like to see added, as well as other features, and I will try my best to implement them.
